# GDB Cheat Sheet

## Starting QEMU and GDB

To debug using GDB and QEMU, first start QEMU like this:

    $ qemu -hda hd.img -s -S

* -s Open gdbserver on TCP port 1234
* -S Don't start CPU at startup

Then start GDB:

    $ gdb

And have gdb connect to qemu:

    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234

## GDB commands

To breakpoint the boot sector:

    (gdb) break *0x7c00

To start:

    (gdb) c

To show registers

    (gdb) info reg

To disassemble an address

    (gdb) x/i 0x7c00

To disassemble at the program counter:

    (gdb) x/i $pc

To disassemble 10 instructions at the program counter:

    (gdb) x/10i $pc

To print the call stack

    (gdb) bt

To single-step, following CALLs

    (gdb) stepi
or
    (gdb) si

To single-step without following CALLs:

    (gdb) nexti
or
    (gdb) ni

To display an instruction on every breakpoint or single-step:

    (gdb) display/i $pc
