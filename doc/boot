= The bootstrap process

== BIOS

The BIOS loads the boot sector, the first sector of the disk, at
0x7c00 and jumps to it in real mode.

== 1st stage loader (boot sector)

The boot sector is loaded at address 0x7c00.  CS will typically be
zero, but may be any value (for example, the BIOS might jump to
0x07c0:0).

The boot sector the 2nd stage loader from disk.  The 2nd stage loader
is stored in sequential sectors starting at sector 1 (the sector
immediately after the boot sector).  It is loaded into low memory and
jumped to.

== 2nd stage loader (current)

The second stage loader gathers information from the BIOS (such as the
memory map) and stores it in low memory for later use by the kernel.
It then switches to protected mode and starts the kernel, which is
currently a part of the 2nd stage loader.

== 2nd stage loader (future)

The second stage loader gathers information from the BIOS (such as the
memory map) and stores it in low memory for later use by the kernel.
It then loads the kernel at into low memory.  The kernel is stored on
disk in sequential sectors starting at at an absolute LBA (eventually,
the kernel will be stored in a file in a regular file system; the 2nd
stage loader will know how to read from the file system).

After loading the kernel, the 2nd stage loader switches to protected
mode.  It enables paging, identity-mapping the lower 4MB, and mapping
4MB of high memory to some available RAM.  It then moves the kernel to
high memory and jumps to it.
