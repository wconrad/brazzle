= The bootstrap process

== BIOS

The BIOS loads the boot sector, the first sector of the disk, at
0x7c00 and jumps to it in real mode.

== 1st stage loader (boot sector)

The boot sector is loaded at address 0x7c00.  CS will typically be
zero, but may be any value (for example, the BIOS might jump to
0x07c0:0).

The boot sector the 2nd stage loader from disk.  The 2nd stage loader
is stored in sequential sectors starting at sector 1 (the sector
immediately after the boot sector).  It is loaded at address 0:0x2000
and jumped to.

== 2nd stage loader (current)

The second stage loader gathers information from the BIOS (such as the
memory map) and stores it in low memory for later use by the kernel.
It then switches to protected mode and starts the kernel, which is
currently a part of the 2nd stage loader.

== 2nd stage loader (future)

The second stage loader gathers information from the BIOS (such as the
memory map) and stores it in low memory for later use by the kernel.
It then loads the kernel at 0x3000.  The kernel is stored on disk in
sequential sectors starting at sector 100 (eventually, the kernel will
be stored in a file in a regular file system; the 2nd stage loader
will know how to read from the file system).

After loading the kernel, the 2nd stage loader switches to protected
mode.  It then moves the kernel to 0xc0000000 and jumps to it.
